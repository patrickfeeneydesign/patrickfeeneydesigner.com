                                <p>Inspired by design from the late 90's and early 00's, 'Fat Of The Land' is a video game reflecting on the ground breaking album The Fat Of The Land by the Prodigy. A dance album through and through, I wanted to create an experience to mimic the feeling of a night out in a fictional city. With grime and atmosphere to boot. Each room is anchored by a map which leads the player around the experience. Inside each venue there is a hidden disk which the players must discover. Upon finding each disk it will appear in their home page available as a custom album design to purchase. The best way to experience the game is to play through yourself! <br><br>The prototype is fully functional on desktop. I was influenced by retro RPG design, as well as the indie game 'Sewer Rave' in which you explore a selection of rooms with dancing rats. The most important aspect of these research sources are their ability to foster atmosphere. <br><br>Especially when engaging with artistic medium, nostalgia and atmosphere become the primary driver of emotive connections. With this in mind, I wanted something to tap into the nostalgic memories of the audience. I also explored the website 'Poolsuite' which emulates a 90's desktop and is centred around music exploration, again deeply nostalgic. The video game ROM uses a map as the core structure of the design, this was effective because it anchors the audience in a space, and makes them feel as if they have agency. It became clear early on that a functioning and open map was vital for the success of any design. I was also inspired by the Daniel Stettner archive on are.na which showcased retro video game design from that period, this archive helped influence my final CD designs. The webiste was built using the platform Editor X and has some of the quirks of an early web development project, but thankfully since this project I've brushed up on my skills and now my HTML and CSS is top notch!
